# 6630-lego-set-visualizer

This is Chris Marston & Vista Marston's Final Project for CS 5630 - Visualization for Data Science.

This project is a website built using D3 that explores the history of The Lego Group's primary toy line Legos. It answers questions such as "How has the number of pieces per set changed over time?" and "Which colors of bricks are the most common?" and has guided components that show the user different trends explicitly, as well as interactive components that allow the user to explore the data a bit on their own.

## Docs

A narrated demo of the project can be found [here](https://youtu.be/3ny4F6x01Zs) and a live version of the project can be found [here](https://krisairdancer.github.io/6630-lego-set-visualizer/index.html).

Our Process Book, which contains information on the design process of this project, can be found in the "documentation" directory of this project.

The data for this project was retrieved from the [Rebrickable Lego Database](https://rebrickable.com/) which makes their database of Lego pieces and sets available to the public [here](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/).

The website and visualizations were built using plain JavaScript and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/). No other libraries were used.
